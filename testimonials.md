- "Brian is the best statistics tutor! My daughter wishes she found him earlier. VERY knowledgeable and responsible tutor. Smart and kind too!"
- "Brian is a superb educator. He has helped me navigate graduate level statistics courses with ease and is always down to take the extra time to walk through each concept to make sure I digest everything. His ability to help identify the big picture of particularly complex subjects is a huge asset. Thanks Brian!"
- "AWESOME tutor. He is patient, VERY knowledgeable, he knows Stats extremely well, and he is a very good teacher. He doesn't get frustrated with my questions (and I ask MANY) and it is abundantly clear he has very strong knowledge of stats."
- "Brian had helped me over a 2 hour session with my distributions test in AP Statistics, and I had immediately felt so much more confident about a substantial test coming up the next day. He had clearly and understandably explained all the concepts I was very shaky about. Brian made sure I was following every step of the way and provided me with alternative easier strategies for attacking each problem. I couldn't recommend anyone better for any help you could ask for with AP Statistics! I definitely will be reaching out again!"
- "Brian provided tutoring in my college course on the theory of statistics, which includes the topics of maximum likelihood estimators and tests, convergence in probability and distribution, and Monte Carlo simulations. Brian reviewed class notes, provided in-depth explanations, and routinely assessed my comprehension. He is knowledgeable and capable of teaching complex topics, and he is very flexible and accommodating with his time. Iâ€™ve tried numerous tutors for upper-level math classes, and Brian is the only one who has been able to meet my needs."
- "Brian is wonderful! He is extremely knowledgeable and patient. He explains things in understandable ways and is goes the extra mile for learners! I highly recommend Brian for statistics tutoring."
