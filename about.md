I am a statistician, data scientist, and educator.  I have taught at top universities including University of Texas, University of Michigan, and University of Notre Dame and have over 1000 hours of experience tutoring online.  Formerly, I was a data scientist at Google where I analyzed A/B experiments, served as a statistical consultant, and taught statistics to non-technical team members.


I specialize in the following subjects:
- AP Statistics
- Introductory College Statistics
