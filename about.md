I am a statistician, educator, and data scientist.  I have taught at top universities including University of Texas, University of Michigan, and University of Notre Dame and have over 500 hours of experience tutoring online.  Formerly, I was a data scientist at Google where I analyzed A/B experiments, served as a statistical consultant, and taught statistics to non-technical team members.

I specialize in the following subjects:
- AP Statistics
- Introductory College Statistics
- Mathematical Statistics for Undergraduate, Masters, and PhD Students
- Statistics Preparation for Data Scientist Job Interviews

If you would like to schedule a tutoring appointment, please [contact me](https://forms.gle/Ms9915cmL9Bw8DVd6) and I will respond quickly.  Standard appointments are $100 per hour.
